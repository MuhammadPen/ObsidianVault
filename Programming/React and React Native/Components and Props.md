# Component
* React components are JavaScript functions. 
* They accept arbitrary inputs (called "[[#Props]]") and return React elements in the form of JSX
* Components can also be defined via the class syntax by extending React.Component.

# Props

* A "props" is an object that is passed to a [[#Components]] as an argument.
* This object contains some data.
* So props can be defined as object argument with data.
