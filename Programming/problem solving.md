Steps

1. Identify - (1 hr => 55 min think about the problem. solve in 5. - Einstein)

	1.  Context (what is the requirement)
	2. Issue (what exactly is the issue/s)
	3. why should we solve this problem?
2. Research and Refine
	1. Research solutions about the problem and see other people's interpretations.
		1. reading documentations on relevant technologies
		2. googling, stack overflow etc.
	2. Refine the problem into smaller solvable units.
3. Pseudocode - focus on logic and not language.
	1. Before writing the pseudocode, make sure to read the technology's documentations to familiarize yourself with the tools you have.
	2. Here language does not refer to only syntax. Extend this into language of images (i.e drawing out the problem), simple words and such.
4. Recommended - Test driven development
	1. Allows you to segment your solution into smaller tests that you can validate as your more forward.
5. Implement - If you have done the above steps with thoroughness, this step will be the easiest and most simple.
	1. Keep in mind, Done is better than perfect. Focus on having your tests pass first. We can improve and perfect the code later on. Getting something done will give yot a sense of accomplishment and confidence that is lacking if you try to prefect your work on the first try.
6. Reflect - Now you can take some time off coding and focus on how you can make your solution/code better. This might involve :
	1. Simple refactoring to make the code more readable.
	2. Optimizing the time and space complexity of your code.
	3. Finding more creative ways to implement the solution.
	4. Improve error handling.
	5. etc.
		1. Just remember that it is easier and more reliable to improve a working solution than to make it perfect from the get go.
7. Review - Get someone who is more experienced to look at the problem and your solutions and get their review and criticisms on it. This is the best way to improve.


Finally, keeping these steps in mind :

Identify -> Research and refine -> Pseudocode -> Implement -> Reflect -> Review

continue to practice problem solving in a general sense so much until these steps become intuitive; Not only in engineering but also in daily life as well.
